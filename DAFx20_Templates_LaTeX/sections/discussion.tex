\section{Results and Discussion}

The main difference with \cite{Willemsen2021}, is that the method is applied to a system of first-order equations rather than the second-order 1D wave equation.

The right side of the velocity ``drifts''

Use average to prevent drift when $\alpha = 0$ and stays 0.


Experiments have been done with alternating between calculating the virtual grid points using the pressure and the velocity.  


\SWcomment[Rather than adding points to the left and right system in alternating fashion, points are added to pressures $p$ and $q$ and velocities $v$ and $w$ respectively]
