In this paper, a complete simulation of a trombone using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods is proposed. In particular, we propose the use of a novel method to dynamically vary the number of grid points associated to the FDTD method, to simulate the fact that the physical dimension of the trombone's resonator dynamically varies over time.
We describe the different elements of the model and present the results of a real-time simulation.
