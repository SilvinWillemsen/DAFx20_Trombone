We propose a complete simulation of a trombone based on finite difference schemes (FDSs). In particular, we propose a novel method to dynamically vary the grid spacing in the grid, to simulate the fact that that physical dimension of the trombone's resonator vary dynamically over time.
We describe the different elements of the model and present the results of our simulations.
