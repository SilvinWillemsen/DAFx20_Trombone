\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented a full implementation of the trombone including a lip reed, radiation and a tube, discretised using FDTD methods on a dynamic grid. Informal evaluation by the authors shows that the implementation exhibits no audible artifacts when grid points are added and removed, even under relatively fast variation in tube length. Naturally, this needs to be confirmed by formal listening tests. Moreover, the simulation easily runs in real-time allowing it to be used as an audio plugin. 

Future work will include extending the tube model to include more realistic viscothermal and nonlinear effects and variable collision stiffness in the lip model. Furthermore, the investigation of more intuitive control parameter mappings is a necessary step towards a real-time instrument.
