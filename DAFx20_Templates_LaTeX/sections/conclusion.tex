\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have presented a full implementation of the trombone including a lip reed, radiation and a tube, discretised using FDTD methods on a dynamic grid. The implementation shows no audible artefacts when grid points are added and removed, even under relatively fast variation in tube length. Moreover, the simulation easily runs in real-time allowing it to be used as an audio plugin. 

Future work will include extending the tube model to include more realistic viscothermal and nonlinear effects. Furthermore, the investigation of more intuitive control parameter mappings is a necessary step towards a real-time instrument.
