\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presented a full implementation of the trombone using FDTD methods including a lip reed, bell-radiation and a tube discretised using a dynamic grid.



Investigate the possibility of adding / removing grid points at points where the cross-sectional area is varying.
