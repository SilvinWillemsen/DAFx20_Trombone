\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented a full implementation of the trombone including a lip reed, bell-radiation and a tube discretised using FDTD methods using a dynamic grid. The implementation shows no audible artefacts when grid points are added and removed, even at higher-speed parameter changes. Moreover, the simulation runs at a maximum of 10.1\% CPU allowing it to be easily used as an audio plugin. 

Future work includes extending the tube model to include viscothermal losses and nonlinear effects to sound more realistic. Furthermore, a more intuitive parameter mapping when controlling the real-time application could be investigated.
