\section{Dynamic grid}\label{sec:dynamicGrid}
Arguably the most characteristic feature of the trombone is its slide with which the length of the tube is altered and the resonating pitch is changed. In a companion article \cite{Willemsen2021}, we present a method to dynamically change grid configurations of FDSs by adding and subtracting grid points based on paramters describing the system.

Although in \cite{Willemsen2021} the wave speed $c$ is altered, 

We can split the FDS shown in \eqref{eq:FDS} into two systems connected at their inner boundaries. The system is split at the end of the slide

The points are added at the far end of the slide so that there is an (approximately) equal slide-length on both sides of where the points are added. 
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\bar S_\lg}{\rho_0 c^2}\delta_{t+}p_\lp^n &= -\delta_{x-}(S_{\lg+1/2}v_{\lp+1/2}^{n+1/2}),\label{eq:discPressure}\\
        \rho_0 \delta_{t-}v_{\lp+1/2}^{n+1/2}&=-\delta_{x+}p_\lp^n,\label{eq:discVelocity}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\bar S_\lg}{\rho_0 c^2}\delta_{t+}q_\lq^n &= -\delta_{x-}(S_{\lg+1/2}w_{\lq+1/2}^{n+1/2}),\label{eq:discPressure}\\
        \rho_0 \delta_{t-}w_{\lq+1/2}^{n+1/2}&=-\delta_{x+}q_\lq^n,\label{eq:discVelocity}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $q$ is the pressure of the right side of the tube
Though the paper shows changes in the wavespeed $c$ rather than the length $L$, the effect of a change in either of these parameters has an identical effect on the system. 

As long a the geometry is unchanged for the grid points. 

To stick to what is physically logical, $L$ is changed


A visual of the calculations used at the connection location of the two schemes can be found in Figure \ref{fig:dynamicGridSchematic}.

As the geometry varies it matters a lot where points are added and subtracted.

To prevent cluttering, arrows going straight up (indicating that the state of a grid point at time step $n$ is needed to calculate the state of that grid point at $n+1$) are suppressed. As an example of the usual case, the points required to calculate $p_2^{n+1}$ are shown. Furthermore, the points needed to calculate $p_{M_p}^{n+1}$ and $q_0^{n+1}$ are shown. The most important difference with the usual case is that the virtual grid points $p_{M_p+1}^n$ %and $w_{-1/2}^n$ 
    are the result of the interpolation of known pressure values at $n$ %and velocity values at $n+1/2$ respectively
    %. \SWcomment[Seemingly, $q_0^n$ is not calculated from anything, but it is simply $q_0^{n+1}$ time-shifted back. The same would be shown for $v_{M_p+1/2}^{n-1/2}$, but the figure does not go back-in-time more than this.]
